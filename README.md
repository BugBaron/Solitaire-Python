A recreation of Solitaire in Python

To move a card, click on the card and click on where you would like to move it to.
Valid destinations are outlined in green, and you can cancel the move by clicking on the same card again, outlined in red.

To flip a card from the deck, click on the face-down pile of cards. When this pile is empty, click on it again to reset the pile.

Aces can be placed on any of the four empty piles in the top left, and Kings can be placed in empty piles in the main section of the board.
